# DevelopingDataProductsPresentation

This is the presentation for the Assignment of the developing data products course of the data science spezialisation on Coursera.
In this Asssignment you should develop a shiny app. I created an app to demonstrate the central limit theorem. This presentation shows what can be explored with the app.
